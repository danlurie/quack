# QuACK Presentations
QuACK (Quantitative Analysis &amp; Coding Knowledge) is a series of optional workshops intended for first year graduate students in the Psychology PhD program at UC Berkeley. The goal is to teach the practical, day-to-day statistical and computational skills that are so important in science but often aren't covered in traditional coursework. 

This repository contains presentations I've made at QuACK and any associated files.
